# Shapes

This project follows tutorials found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Q5NryHN5s&t=671s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HMtarQAt3A&t=1193s

This is a React.js project. The user can modify a list of plane shapes by adding new shapes, or deleting existing ones.

This project uses the Panel and Modal components from React Bootstrap.

Each shape, and its attributes, are stored in an array of shape objects.

Shape names are displayed using .map() and by setting Panel.Title.

The application allows the user to add shapes through the use of .slice(), .push(), .split(), .target.value, and this.setState. It allows the user to delete shapes using .slice(), .splice(), and this.setState.
