# Shapes

Using React.js, I created a list that the user can modify. (Rather than a "to-do" list or ingredient list, this is a list of plane shapes.)

The list was created using Panel and Accordion components from ReactBootstrap.

Each shape, and its attributes, are stored in an array of shape objects.

Shape names are displayed using .map() and by setting the Panel header.

The application allows the user to add shapes through the use of .slice(), .push(), .target.value, and this.setState.
